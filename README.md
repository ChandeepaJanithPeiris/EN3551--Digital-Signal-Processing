###  Assignment 1 : Detecting Harmonics in Noisy Data and Signal Interpolation using DFT
This assignment focuses on the practical applications of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for harmonic detection and signal interpolation. It involves detecting sinusoidal components from a noisy signal by utilizing DFT averaging, which helps cancel out noise effects, making the harmonic peaks more visible. 
The second part of the assignment delves into frequency-domain interpolation using zero insertion, where the DFT is employed to interpolate a down-sampled music signal. By zero-padding and applying the Inverse DFT, the interpolated signals are compared with the original signal to assess accuracy.
